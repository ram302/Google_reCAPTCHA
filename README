Basic use of Google's new reCAPTCHA API version 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will assume that the web developer has already set up an account with Google 
(https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) and that the SITE_KEY (in index.php) 
and site's SECRET_KEY (in process.php) are available. This will not work properly 
until the keys are properly entered.


File List:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- index.php
	This will display a short form with Google's reCAPTCHA div element. Replace 
	SITE_KEY with one provided by Google for your site. Upon the user's 
	confirmation, the form is submitted to process.php for a reCAPTCHA 
	response. Once the data is processed, and a desireable response is returned, 
	you may continue.

- process.php 
	Dependent of index.php via AJAX (JQuery) POST call; will return the result of 
	the subsequent call to Google for a response on the reCAPTCHA interaction. 
	Replace SECRET_KEY with your site's secret key provided by Google.


Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Index.php will request response from process.php via AJAX call. Upon 
	confirmation (success), programmer may proceed. Process.php will send
	POST request to Google for sucess confirmation.r
